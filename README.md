**Target Audience: Students of French**

* Users are more likely to be tested on the verbs they struggle with the most thanks to our spaced-repetition algorithm

# Spaced-Repetition Algorithm

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that emphasizes the review of unlearned over learned material. Oui Verb implements this approach by monitoring users' progress and recording their quiz results as they work through our content. When a user incorrectly conjugates or translates a verb during one of our quizzes, a reference to that verb is saved as a part of that user's data. Later, when the user takes another quiz, Oui Verb first checks these references to grab verbs that the user has struggled with in the past.
